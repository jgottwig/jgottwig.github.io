Poetry that I consider to be in some sort of finished state. This is not confessional poetry... generally just character studies or ideas I want to explore.

One of my poems was nominated for a Rhysling Award. That was a long time ago.

Note that I'll sometimes put poems under public version control. See my [Thoughts and Ruminations](https://github.com/jgottwig/thoughts-ruminations) repo.
