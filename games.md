I like Blender. I like Unreal Engine and Unity. Skeeter's Grid, an isometric puzzle game build with Unity and Blender, is upcoming. I also like interactive fiction and have small projects built in Ink Script, TADS3, and Twine.

In this space, find information about my games, my IF, and my general thoughts about games and gaming.
