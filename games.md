I build games inspired by the games I played as a kid on ye olde Commodore 64. Skeeter's Grid, an isometric puzzle game build with Unity and Blender, is upcoming.

I also like interactive fiction and have small projects built in Ink Script, TADS3, and Twine.

In this space, find information about my games, development, IF, and my general thoughts about gaming.
