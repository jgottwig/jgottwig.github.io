I like Blender. I like Unreal Engine and Unity. Skeeter's Grid, an isometric puzzle game build with Unity and Blender, is upcoming. I also like interactive fiction and have small projects built in Ink Script, TADS3, and Twine.

In this space, find information about games, IF, and my general thoughts about gaming.
