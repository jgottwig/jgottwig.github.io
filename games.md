I build the sorts of games I enjoyed playing as a kid on ye olde Commodore 64. Skeeter's Grid, an isometric puzzle game vaguely inspired by those experiences, is upcoming.

I also like interactive fiction and have developed a number of small IF projects. Most of these are experiments. For example, I once built a VR IF framework using Unreal Engine in which story choices manifested as virtual objects (I may or may not eventually do more with this).

In this space, find information about my games, development, IF, and my general thoughts about gaming.
