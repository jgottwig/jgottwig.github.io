I've been writing for years. My stories have appeared in numerous literary and speculative publications. One of my stories won a literary prize, and I had started work on a novel and an MFA.

When the pandemic hit, and I found myself stuck indoors, I decided to change things up. For me, this meant learning more about interactive fiction and teaching myself Unity. My young son has always been vocal about wanting to be a game developer when he grows up, so I figured I'd learn and could start teaching him the basics to pass the time, but life is funny sometimes. I absolutely fell in love with game engines and game development. Thus, I spent my pandemic learning Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender.

From here on out, I imagine I'll bounce between writing, interactive fiction, and game projects. This website is devoted to those pursuits.
