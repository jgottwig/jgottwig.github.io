## Games and Apps
Strange Shuttle LLC does not collect player data in Skeeter's Grid or any future games. If the game engine, Unity, ever begins collecting data by default (it currently doesn't), Strange Shuttle LLC will attempt to disable this functionality.

For more information about privacy in Unity, visit <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity's Privacy Policy page</a>.

If you email Strange Shuttle LLC, your email address and any associated metadata will be stored in the email client, but it will not be used for any purpose other than to reply to the message.

## Website
In the past, StrangeShuttle.com has used Google Analytics to collect data, but this is no longer the case.

## Online Stores
Online stores, where Strange Shuttle games are sold, likely maintain stat and analytics, which Strange Shuttle has some access to. Please refer to privacy policies of those online stores for more information.
