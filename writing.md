I write fiction, usually with speculative elements, sometimes not. Sometimes I write poetry. It just depends on my mood.

I am a proponent of a [git + markdown flow](https://github.com/jgottwig/writers-flow) of writing using open formats and software development techniques. I'm providing my own workflow [as an example](https://github.com/jgottwig/writers-flow). Pull requests welcome.
