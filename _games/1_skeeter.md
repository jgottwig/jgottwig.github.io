Re-connect mixed-up circuits in this 80s-inspired isometric puzzler as you move from grid-to-grid, each of increasing complexity and variation. Augment your own functionality as you explore each system, with the chance of gathering additional collectable components during replays.

### Key Features
* Dozens of grids, some quite massive, with a wide variety of cubes and functionalities.
* Statistics recorded for solving every grid variation.
* Bonus achievements for using every circuit on the board. Or just speed-run through if that's your preference. It's up to you.
* Original ambient / chill soundtrack, which subtly evolves as Skeet moves between grids.
* Full Steam Deck and gamepad support in addition to keyboard (WASD + arrow keys).
