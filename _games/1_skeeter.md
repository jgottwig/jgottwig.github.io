You play Skeet, master defragmenter, in this sit-and-chill isometric puzzler. Spin, move, and swap pieces as you restore sectors, each of increasing complexity and variation. Collect cores along the way to improve your functionality, and meet the AIs, who may or may not be benevolent.

Chill out on Skeeter's Grid!

### Key Features
* Randomly shuffled grids with statistics recorded for every variation.
* Bonus points and achievements for using every piece on the sector, or just speed-run through if that's your preference. It's up to you.
* Original ambient soundtrack evolves as Skeet ascends from sector to sector.
* Collect cores you'll need to augment Skeet's abilities, and learn about other microdaemons along the way.
* Pick sides in a conflict between two AIs. The story evolves along with your choices.
* Seamless transitions between sectors with zero loading.
