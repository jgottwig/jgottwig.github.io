The grid is no longer safe!

Re-connect mixed-up circuits in this isometric puzzler as you ascend from board to board, each of increasing complexity and variation. Rescue other bots, the guardians of the grid, on your hunt for your home board and whatever malevolent virus is corrupting the system.

In Skeeter's Grid, not all bugs are bad!

### Key Features (in development [see changelog](/games/skeeters-grid-changelog/))
* Replayable: Randomly shuffled boards with stats recorded for every variation.
* Addictive: Bonus achievements for using every circuit on the board. Or just burn through if that's your preference. It's up to you.
* Collect: Gather up the components you'll need to rebuild the other bots and secure the grid.
