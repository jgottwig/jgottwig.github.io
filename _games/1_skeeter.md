Chill out on Skeeter's Grid...

Re-connect mixed-up circuits in this 80s-inspired isometric puzzler as you move from board to board, each of increasing complexity and variation. Collect components, remnants of former grid guardians, as you rebuild the system.

### Key Features (in development [see changelog](/games/skeeters-grid-changelog/))
* Dozens of boards, all randomly shuffled, with statistics recorded for every variation.
* Bonus achievements for using every circuit on the board. Or just speed-run through if that's your preference. It's up to you.
* Original ambient / chill soundtrack, which subtly evolves as Skeet moves from board to board and sector to sector. 
* Collect additional components on repeat play-throughs.
