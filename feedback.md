The easiest way to contact me or offer general feedback is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jgottwig). I don't tweet often, but I generally check twitter several times each day and will do my best to respond.  I am also somewhat active on [Gamejolt](https://strangeshuttle.gamejolt.io/), but I am still working this into my daily routines.

If you have encountered a bug playing Skeeter's Grid, I've set up a [public issue tracker](https://github.com/jgottwig/SkeetersGrid-Issues/issues). Please submit a ticket! I do my best to find and quash all bugs, but I am but a simple solo dev from the back country and can't play through every scenario.
